Objective: 
Design and implement a Flappy Bird game console using digital logic and design, controlled by a PS/2 mouse and displayed on a VGA screen.
 Equipment: DE0-CV FPGA board, PS/2 mouse, VGA to HDMI adapter, and necessary software (ModelSim, Quartus Prime 18.1).

Game Features:
 Bird movement controlled by a PS/2 mouse; free-falls when not flapping.
 Obstacles and gifts appear randomly; screen scrolls horizontally.
 Two modes: TRAINING (practice) and GAME (increasing difficulty).
 
Tasks:
 Understand game and hardware functionality.
 Design game components in VHDL, simulate and synthesize.
 Integrate components, analyze resource usage and timing performance.
 Collaborate in groups, provide individual contributions and peer assessments
